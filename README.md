## Catalogue of resources explaining how to invlove undergraduates in genomics research 

While the benefits of undergraduate research experiences (UREs) are recognized for undergraduates, the advantages of UREs for graduate students, post-doctoral scholars, and faculty are not clearly outlined. The analysis of genomic data is particularly well-suited for successful involvement of undergraduates. 

We have prepared an online catalogue of resources and published papers aimed at addressing the teaching-research divide in computational genomics. The catalogue was prepared for our study "Involving undergraduates in genomics research to narrow the education-research gap" [https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.3149v1] (https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.3149v1)
